Software engineer trying to keep coding skills relevant in an age where technology is changing at an ever quickening pace.

### More Information

Started learning to code in 1985 in college on a main frame (HP2000) using COBOL and FORTRAN. Graduated college after a long absence in 2006. I have worked in both the hardware (electronics) as well as the software realms of computing. I am sort of a “jack-of-all-trades” Since I work for the government I have had a large amount of project management experience, but my passion is code and technology innovation.
