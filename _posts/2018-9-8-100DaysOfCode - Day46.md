## Day 46: September 8, Saturday

**Today 's Progress**: Finished work on the React on Redux challenges, One piece of advice I can give someone going through this is don't over think the misleading instructions. Google is your friend! The content is here: [Introduction to the React and Redux Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react-and-redux).

**Thoughts**: Took a several hours to figure this last one out. I think I must have read the instruction 10 times and trying to figure out how to tackle this monster. All I know is React and Redux are tough.

### Resources used:
  * [Redux middleware is not defined](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32804097/redux-middleware-is-not-defined),

  **React and Redux: Moving Forward From Here**
  OMG I totally spent 2 hours trying to get this!!! TOTALLY TERRIBLE!
* Congratulations! You finished the lessons on React and Redux. There's one last item worth pointing out before you move on. Typically, you won't write React apps in a code editor like this. This challenge gives you a glimpse of what the syntax looks like if you're working with npm and a file system on your own machine. The code should look similar, except for the use of import statements (these pull in all of the dependencies that have been provided for you in the challenges). The "Managing Packages with npm" section covers npm in more detail.

Finally, writing React and Redux code generally requires some configuration. This can get complicated quickly. If you are interested in experimenting on your own machine, the

[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) comes configured and ready to go.

Alternatively, you can enable Babel as a JavaScript Preprocessor in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/), add React and ReactDOM as external JavaScript resources, and work there as well.


**Log the message 'Now I know React and Redux!' to the console.**

```Javascript
// import React from 'react'
// import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
// import { Provider, connect } from 'react-redux'
// import { createStore, combineReducers, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'
// import thunk from 'redux-thunk'

// import rootReducer from './redux/reducers'
// import App from './components/App'

// const store = createStore(
//   rootReducer,
//   applyMiddleware(thunk)
// );

// ReactDOM.render(
//   <Provider store={store}>
//     <App/>
//   </Provider>,
//   document.getElementById('root')
// );

// change code below this line
console.log('Now I know React and Redux!');//Added this to make test pass?????
