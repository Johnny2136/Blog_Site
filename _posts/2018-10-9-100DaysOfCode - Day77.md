## Day 77: October 09, Tuesday

**Today 's Progress**: Next steps are deploying my local app now that its working in a local dev environment. I need to find a way to deploy it.

**Thoughts**: I read some on using CA certifications and Testing VUE apps. I will have to learn how to deploy my app.

### Resources used:
  * [Github repo for todoApp](https://github.com/Johnny2136/my-todo-app)
  * [Vue.js.org](https://vuejs.org/)
  * [VUE.JS - SIMPLE TODO APP - PART 1](http://iamkumaran.github.io/vue-js/vue-js-todo-app-part-1.html)

It works... learning deployment.
