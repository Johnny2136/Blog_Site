## Day 98: October 30, Tuesday

**Today 's Progress** Still on my break from TDD and did a couple D3.js challenges on FreeCodeCamp [Data Visualization with D3: Dynamically Set the Coordinates for Each Bar](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-with-d3/dynamically-set-the-coordinates-for-each-bar).

**Thoughts** Had to take a break from TDD its making my head hurt...

### Resources used:

* [D3: setting style conditionally with immediately invoked arrow function and ternary](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45593251/d3-setting-style-conditionally-with-immediately-invoked-arrow-function-and-tern/45654334)
* [D3 Tutorial](https://www.dashingd3js.com/table-of-contents)
* [D3 in Depth](https://d3indepth.com/)

**Dynamically Set the Coordinates for Each Bar**
Example: The `attr()` method in D3 accepts a callback function to dynamically set that attribute. The callback function takes two arguments, one for the data point itself (usually d) and one for the index of the data point in the array. The second argument for the index is optional. Here's the format:

```javascript
    selection.attr("property", (d, i) => {
      /*
      * d is the data point value
      * i is the index of the data point in the array
      */
    })
```
It's important to note that you do NOT need to write a for loop or use `forEach()` to iterate over the items in the data set. Recall that the `data()` method parses the data set, and any method that's chained after `data()` is run once for each item in the data set.

**Challange Instructions:** Change the `x` attribute callback function so it returns the index times 30.

Note Each bar has a width of 25, so increasing each x value by 30 adds some space between the bars. Any value greater than 25 would work in this example.

**My solution**

```html
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [12, 31, 22, 17, 25, 18, 29, 14, 9];

    const w = 500;
    const h = 100;

    const svg = d3.select("body")
                  .append("svg")
                  .attr("width", w)
                  .attr("height", h);

    svg.selectAll("rect")
       .data(dataset)
       .enter()
       .append("rect")
       .attr("x", (d, i) => {
         // Add your code below this line

         return i*30;

         // Add your code above this line
       })
       .attr("y", 0)
       .attr("width", 25)
       .attr("height", 100);
  </script>
</body>
```
