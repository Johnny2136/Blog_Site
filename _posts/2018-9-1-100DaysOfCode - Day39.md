title: Day 39 of 100 Days Of Code

## Day 39: September, Saturday

**Today 's Progress**: I started Redux [Introduction to the Redux Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/redux).

**Thoughts**: Just when you think you are done with a frustrating framework, there comes Redux ARRRRGGGGHHHH!!!!! Worse than ReactJS!!!!

### Resources used:
  * [A Simple Naming Convention for Action Creators in Redux.js](https://decembersoft.com/posts/a-simple-naming-convention-for-action-creators-in-redux-js/)
```Redux
const action = {
  type: 'LOGIN'
}
// Define an action creator here:
function actionCreator(action){
    return {
        type: LOGIN,
    action
    };
};
```

This was a VERY hard challenge, instructions were not very clear at all and there were no examples.
