## Day 100: November 1, Thursday

**Today 's Progress** Finished my #100DaysOfCode Challenge with a couple D3.js challenges on FreeCodeCamp [Data Visualization with D3: Create a Linear Scale with D3](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/data-visualization/data-visualization-with-d3/create-a-linear-scale-with-d3/).

**Final Thoughts** Its been a hard 100 days but let me see if I can summarize: This journey started on July 25th of this year, I felt like I had to keep my coding skills up to date, since project management doesn't allow for hands on coding. After the failed whiteboarding interview with USDS I threw myself into coding on my free time as much as possible. Free Code Camp offered a great way to reinforce what I learned in college about wed development and working though the challenges was actually fun, until REACT :) React.js was tough, then came TDD with Jest and VUE.js a whole new thing for me, I still struggle with it a lot. But I learned a lot during this 100 days! Advances in JavaScript, Became a SME on CICD/ and Open Shift. I also earned certificates in [JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/johnny2136/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures) and [Front End Libraries](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/johnny2136/front-end-libraries). My GitHub profile sows over 100 days of straight contributions here https://github.com/Johnny2136, my blog here: https://johnny2136.github.io/ Documents my thoughts and activities as well as my Log on the 100 days challenges. I found some awesome new developers working their way through [CodeClan](https://codeclan.com/) in Scotland, and following their journeys as they begin learning to code. I started supporting more diversity in STEM positions by promoting programs supporting getting more women and girls interested in STEM. I learned to use VSCode IDE and Atom, as well as Code Pen, Code Sandbox, JS fiddle, and cloud9 IDE. I plan on taking some time off and relaxing a bit, but also I plan on carrying on with my studies on TDD and doing my code projects to keep up with modern coding techniques. Its been a real challenge, the day after Oral surgery the last thing I wanted to do was code but I did it! It feels good to have seen this challenge through now on to the next steps.

#### Add Labels to Scatter Plot Circles

**Example:**
You can add text to create labels for the points in a scatter plot.

The goal is to display the comma-separated values for the first (x) and second (y) fields of each item in dataset.

The text nodes need x and y attributes to position it on the SVG canvas. In this challenge, the y value (which determines height) can use the same value that the circle uses for its cy attribute. The x value can be slightly larger than the cx value of the circle, so the label is visible. This will push the label to the right of the plotted point.

**Challenge Instructions:**
Label each point on the scatter plot using the text elements. The text of the label should be the two values separated by a comma and a space. For example, the label for the first point is "34, 78". Set the x attribute so it's 5 units more than the value you used for the cx attribute on the circle. Set the y attribute the same way that's used for the cy value on the circle.

**My solution**
```html
<body>
  <script>
    const dataset = [
                  [ 34,    78 ],
                  [ 109,   280 ],
                  [ 310,   120 ],
                  [ 79,    411 ],
                  [ 420,   220 ],
                  [ 233,   145 ],
                  [ 333,   96 ],
                  [ 222,   333 ],
                  [ 78,    320 ],
                  [ 21,    123 ]
                ];


    const w = 500;
    const h = 500;

    const svg = d3.select("body")
                  .append("svg")
                  .attr("width", w)
                  .attr("height", h);

    svg.selectAll("circle")
       .data(dataset)
       .enter()
       .append("circle")
       .attr("cx", (d, i) => d[0])
       .attr("cy", (d, i) => h - d[1])
       .attr("r", 5);

    svg.selectAll("text")
       .data(dataset)
       .enter()
       .append("text")
       // Add your code below this line

       .text((d) => (d[0] + ", " + d[1]))
       .attr("x", (d) => (d[0] + 5))
       .attr("y", (d) => (h - d[1]));  

       // Add your code above this line
  </script>
</body>
```

#### Create a Linear Scale with D3
**Example:**
The bar and scatter plot charts both plotted data directly onto the SVG canvas. However, if the height of a bar or one of the data points were larger than the SVG height or width values, it would go outside the SVG area.

In D3, there are scales to help plot data. Scales are functions that tell the program how to map a set of raw data points onto the pixels of the SVG canvas.

For example, say you have a 100x500-sized SVG canvas and you want to plot Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for a number of countries. The set of numbers would be in the billion or trillion-dollar range. You provide D3 a type of scale to tell it how to place the large GDP values into that 100x500-sized area.

It's unlikely you would plot raw data as-is. Before plotting it, you set the scale for your entire data set, so that the x and y values fit your canvas width and height.

D3 has several scale types. For a linear scale (usually used with quantitative data), there is the D3 method scaleLinear():

`const scale = d3.scaleLinear()`

By default, a scale uses the identity relationship. The value of the input is the same as the value of the output. A separate challenge covers how to change this.

**Challange Instructions:**
Change the scale variable to create a linear scale. Then set the output variable to the scale called with an input argument of 50.

**My solution**
```html
<body>
  <script>
    // Add your code below this line

    const scale = d3.scaleLinear() // Create the scale here
    const output = scale(50); // Call the scale with an argument here

    // Add your code above this line

    d3.select("body")
      .append("h2")
      .text(output);

  </script>
</body>
```
