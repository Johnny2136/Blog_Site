title: Day 6 of 100 Days Of Code
---
## Day 6: July 30, Monday

 **Today 's Progress**: I started challanges in [Introduction to Basic Algorithm Scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting) I coded for 1 hour.

**Thoughts**: Today was a tough day I had a 15.5-hour day at work (counting the commute) and was knee deep in Docker CLI. I feel so tired but I managed to get some coding before bed. Tomorrow itâ€™s Kubernetes and another long day. 

```javascript
//The algorithm to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.
function convertToF(celsius) {
  let fahrenheit = celsius * 9/5 + 32 ;// my solution
  return fahrenheit;
}
convertToF(30);
```
