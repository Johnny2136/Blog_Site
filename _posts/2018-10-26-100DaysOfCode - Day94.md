## Day 94: October 26, Friday

**Today 's Progress** Trying to add functionality to my todo app using TDD.

**Thoughts** Coding to make my unit test pass, a bit of luck. No help from the VUE discord community. So i droped back and punt! I erased all my code changes and started with the passing tests...

### Resources used:
  * [https://vue-land.js.org/](https://vue-land.js.org/)
  * [Quasar Framework](https://quasar-framework.org/)
  * [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/getting-started.html)
  * [Vue.js.org](https://vuejs.org/)
  * [Vue-projects repo in github](https://github.com/Johnny2136/my-tdd)

Continuing to work on groking TDD with JEST!

After going back to the passing tests I get:

```shell
> my-prog@0.1.0 test /home/johnny/VUE-apps/my-tdd
> vue-cli-service test:unit

 PASS  tests/unit/steps/Home.steps.js
  Home Page
    ✓ Opening the initial web page (301ms)

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        2.428s
Ran all test suites.
jest-html-reporter >> Report generated (/home/johnny/VUE-apps/my-tdd/test-report.html)
```
Then I added my Gherkin code:

```gherkin
Scenario: List on the initial web page
  Given The page is open in a browser
  When I inspect the page elements
  Then I should see a list QListHeadertitle
  And the QListHeadertitle should contain the correct words
  And the page should contain a QList tag
  And the page should have at least 3 QListItems
```
I then ran the test I totally expected to fail:
(And it did but it gave a nice clue.)

```shell
> vue-cli-service test:unit

 FAIL  tests/unit/steps/Home.steps.js
  Home Page
    ✓ Opening the initial web page (296ms)
    ✕ encountered a declaration exception (26ms)

  ● Home Page › encountered a declaration exception

    Feature file has a scenario titled "List on the initial web page", but no match found in step definitions. Try adding the following code:

    test('List on the initial web page', ({ given, when, then, pending }) => {
        given('The page is open in a browser', () => {
            pending();
        });

        when('I inspect the page elements', () => {
            pending();
        });

        then('I should see a list QListHeadertitle', () => {
            pending();
        });

        then('the QListHeadertitle should contain the correct words', () => {
            pending();
        });

        then('the page should contain a QList tag', () => {
            pending();
        });

        then(/^the page should have at least (.*) QListItems$/, (arg0) => {
            pending();
        });
    });

       9 |
      10 | const feature = loadFeature("tests/unit/features/Home.feature");
    > 11 | defineFeature(feature, test => {
         | ^
      12 |     let localVue;
      13 |     // Initialize the Vue.js rendering engine with Quasar and font-awesome
      14 |     beforeEach(() => {

```
I added the suggested skeleton code:

```javascript
test('List on the initial web page', ({ given, when, then, pending }) => {
        given('The page is open in a browser', () => {
            pending();
        });

        when('I inspect the page elements', () => {
            pending();
        });

        then('I should see a list QListHeadertitle', () => {
            pending();
        });

        then('the QListHeadertitle should contain the correct words', () => {
            pending();
        });

        then('the page should contain a QList tag', () => {
            pending();
        });

        then(/^the page should have at least (.*) QListItems$/, (arg0) => {
            pending();
        });
    });
  ```
now I run `NPM run test` and get:


  ```bash
  [johnny@localhost my-tdd]$ npm run test

> my-prog@0.1.0 test /home/johnny/VUE-apps/my-tdd
> vue-cli-service test:unit

 PASS  tests/unit/steps/Home.steps.js

jest-html-reporter >> Report generated (/home/johnny/VUE-apps/my-tdd/test-report.html)
[johnny@localhost my-tdd]$
  ```
So finally a place where I think I will be able to flesh out the tests and continue with my TDD exploration.

Continue troubleshooting unit testing and then code to make tests pass, using TDD.
