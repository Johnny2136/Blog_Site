## Day 81: October 13, Saturday

**Today 's Progress**: Continuing my work though TDD of Vue.js

**Thoughts**: Recovering from oral surgery day 3! I did not feel like coding but after 80 days of straight coding I had to try. TDD is pretty complicated for me the examples for VUE 3.0 are few and far between.

### Resources used:
  * [Vue Test Utils](https://vue-test-utils.vuejs.org/guides/getting-started.html)
  * [Vue.js.org](https://vuejs.org/)
  * [Vue-projects repo in github](https://github.com/Johnny2136/vuetify-projects)

```bash
johnn@DESKTOP-Johnny5 MINGW64 ~/vue-test-utils-getting-started (master)
$ npm test

> vue-test-utils-getting-started@1.0.0 test C:\Users\johnn\vue-test-utils-getting-started
> jest
