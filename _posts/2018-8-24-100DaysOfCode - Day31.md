## Day 31: August 24, Friday

**Today 's Progress**: I finished work on [Introduction to the Sass Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/sass) and started on React.js [Introduction to the React Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react).

**Thoughts**: The [Introduction to the Sass Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/sass) at first seemed pretty buggy but I can confirm it makes a big difference to use Chrome. I used Chrome to get though the last challenges and had no issues.

### Resources used:
  * [Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets)](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html)
  * [Sass Lang Guide](https://sass-lang.com/guide)
  * [Sass Validator](https://www.sassmeister.com/)
  * [reactjs.org/docs/getting-started](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
  * [repl.it/FCCReactjs](https://repl.it/@JohnJohnson2/FCCReactjs)

```reactjs
//Introduction to the React Challenges:
//Create a Simple JSX Element
//JavaScript within curly braces: { 'this is treated as JavaScript code' }
//under the hood the challenges are calling ReactDOM.render(JSX, document.getElementById('root'))
const JSX = <h1>Hello JSX!</h1>;


//Create a Complex JSX Element
const JSX = (<div>
             <h1>Heading One</h1>
             <p>Paragraph Two</p>
             <ul>
               <li>List one</li>
               <li>List Two</li>
               <li>List Three</li>
             </ul>
            </div>);


//Add Comments in JSX
const JSX = (
  <div>
    <h1>This is a block of JSX</h1>
    {/* This is a comment! */}
    <p>Here's a subtitle</p>
  </div>
);
```

This is something new not sure how I feel about it yet.
