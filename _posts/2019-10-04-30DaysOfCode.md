## Day 8: October 04, Friday

**Today 's Progress**: I am working through getting [30-days-of-code](https://www.hackerrank.com/) but got stuck in Day 8.
**Thoughts**: I started out doing C++ But soon switched to GoLang(As I have been studying that) but had to try JavaScript due to a GO Lang timeout error, As I was able to get past the timeout error using JS.

### Resources used:
  * [Github repo for 30 days of code](https://github.com/Johnny2136/30-Days-of-Code)
  * [HackerRank.com 30 days of code](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-arrays/problem)
  * [GoLang playground](https://play.golang.org/)
  * [golangprograms.com](https://www.golangprograms.com/golang-package-examples.html)

### Objective

Today, we're learning about Key-Value pair mappings using a Map or Dictionary data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task

Given `n` names and phone numbers, assemble a phone book that maps friends' names to their respective phone numbers. You will then be given an unknown number of names to query your phone book for. For each `name` queried, print the associated entry from your phone book on a new line in the form `name=phoneNumber;` if an entry for `name` is not found, print Not found instead.
*Note:* Your phone book should be a Dictionary/Map/HashMap data structure.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, `n`, denoting the number of entries in the phone book.
Each of the `n` subsequent lines describes an entry in the form of 2 space-separated values on a single line. The first value is a friend's name, and the second value is an 8-digit phone number.

After the `n` lines of phone book entries, there are an unknown number of lines of queries. Each line (query) contains a `name` to look up, and you must continue reading lines until there is no more input.

*Note:* Names consist of lowercase English alphabetic letters and are first names only.

### Output Format

On a new line for each query, print Not found if the name has no corresponding entry in the phone book; otherwise, print the full `name` and `phoneNumber` in the format `name=phoneNumber`.

Sample Input
```
3
sam 99912222
tom 11122222
harry 12299933
sam
edward
harry
```
Sample Output
```
sam=99912222
Not found
harry=12299933
```
### My Code
```go
package main
import "fmt"

func main() {
 //Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT
 var n int
    m := make(map[string]int)

    fmt.Scan(&n)

    var name string
    var number int
    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        fmt.Scan(&name)
        fmt.Scan(&number)
        m[name] = number
    }

    var query string
    for {
        _, err := fmt.Scanf("%s", &query)
        if err != nil {
            break
        }
        if value, ok := m[query]; ok {
            fmt.Printf("%s=%d\n", query, value)
        } else {
            fmt.Println("Not found")
        }
    }
}
```
