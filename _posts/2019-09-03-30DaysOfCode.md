## Day 7: September 03, Tuesday

**Today 's Progress**: I am working through getting [30-days-of-code](https://www.hackerrank.com/).
**Thoughts**: I started out doing C++ But soon switched to GoLang As I think the industry is going in that direction.

### Resources used:
  * [Github repo for 30 days of code](https://github.com/Johnny2136/30-Days-of-Code)
  * [HackerRank.com 30 days of code](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-arrays/problem)
  * [GoLang playground](https://play.golang.org/)
  * [golangprograms.com](https://www.golangprograms.com/golang-package-examples.html)

### Objective

Today, we're learning about the Array data structure. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

### Task

Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

### Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N (the size of our array).
The second line contains N space-separated integers describing array A's elements

### Output Format

Print the elements of array

in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.

Sample Input

4
1 4 3 2

Sample Output

2 3 4 1

### My Code
```go
package main

import "fmt"

func printReverse(l, h int, arr []int) {
    switch {
    case l > h:
        return
    default:
        printReverse(l+1, h, arr)
        fmt.Printf("%d ", arr[l])
    }
}

func main() {
    var n int
    fmt.Scan(&n)
    a := make([]int, n)
    for k := range a {
        fmt.Scan(&a[k])
    }
    printReverse(0, n-1, a)
}
```
