## Day 58: September 20, Wednesday

**Today 's Progress**: Took a break from the [Introduction to the Front End Libraries Projects](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects).

**Thoughts**: Set up a local Open Shift cluster on my laptop, and deploying a test application into a tomcat container then make changes then roll back the changes Going to bed now :(
