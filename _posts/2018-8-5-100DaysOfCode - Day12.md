title: Day 12 of 100 Days Of Code
---
## Day 12: August, Sunday

**Today 's Progress**: I worked on the challenges in  [Object Oriented Programming](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/object-oriented-programming) section.

**Thoughts**: These FCC_Challenges were a lot different from the Challenges in the algorithm section that were so tough, there were plenty of good examples and instructions but I manages with the help of Stackoverflow to get them done OOP section seems easy Should get a lot done tomorrow. [resources: Mozella](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter) and [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

```javascript
//Use Prototype Properties to Reduce Duplicate Code
//Add a numLegs property to the prototype of Dog
function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}
Dog.prototype.numLegs = 4;
// Add your code above this line
let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");
console.log(beagle); // prints Snoopy
console.log(Dog); // prints Snoopy
console.log("--------------------------------------------");
```
